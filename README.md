graded assignment lol

To interpret user needs and wants, I can collect user stories and evaluate them based on what the market has, how many users have requested this versus other popular user stories and how possible/viable is that request is at the time. User stories tell me how to get customers engaged and onto the program/site.

I plan to approach developing programs with an open mind and dedication. I need to make myself short term goals and be able to work in an agile environment so that I can bring something to market not only quickly but efficiently.

A good team member will bring a consistent good mood to work, be able to scale and help for the project and team, promote healthy communication, promote healthy development habits and be available for criticism. Being a good team member doesn't end at finishing a job!
